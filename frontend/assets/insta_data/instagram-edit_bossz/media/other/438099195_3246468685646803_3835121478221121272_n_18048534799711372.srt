1
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:10,141
Good morning. What do you mean?
Do you mean to wish me a good

2
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:12,381
morning or do you mean that it
is a good morning whether I

3
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:17,061
want it or not? Or perhaps you
mean to say that you feel good

4
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:21,061
on this particular morning? Or
are you simply stating that

5
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:26,681
this is a morning to be good
on? All of them at once I

6
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:29,081
suppose.
